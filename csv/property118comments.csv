Jason,,"I’m a radio listener and listening to one station all the time gives a skewed view. I listen to Talk radio a lot which is right wing dubbed the “house of common sense” however I’m more recently switching to a more balanced station like Times Radio. It’s depressing listening to the same ureteric that the country is on the way down the pan blah blah blah. I’m starting to feel the same with this site, its click bait headlines and the article comments including my own are focusing on the doom and gl",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
Cider Drinker,,"It is depressing, and rightfully so.
However, I still believe that owning land and property is a good thing. It needs to be the right property (modern, dry, safe) or the right land in areas that are ripe for development. Brownfield sites seem an obvious area for investment (struggling pubs, high street shops).
But I’m too old to be bothered. Time for me to sell up and enjoy retirement.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
northern landlord,,"What doesn’t help are the constant advertorial horror stories by 118 about what is going to happen in the PRS that finish off with an avoid all this, sell up now strapline and a landlord sales agency contact form.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
Kelvin Blakeway,,A more balanced view would help me,https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
Lee Chapman,,"Personally i think the content is fine. Better than people believing being a landlord is a bed of roses. We are fortunate that are not currently pulling income, but are overpaying one of the mortgages to get in a better financial position when we need to start using the income.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
Ryan Stevens,,"As long as it is a fairly balanced view it is fine. Landlords will probably make a higher return, due to a lot of BTL sales resulting from RRB and EPC changes, etc., but at increased risk.
I am in Cider Drinker's boat (or possibly Ark) - my wife and I are at retirement age and it is easier for me to do estate planning. etc if I sell up. So in a couple of years I will be past caring!",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
David Mackley,,"Appreciate the need to reflect reality but your content is extremely negative - I tend to avoid reading it as it's depressing. We know there are loads of issues and more to come - why not focus more on what we can do about it?
Having a stronger lobby voice would be a start btw.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
Downsize Government,,"I just want to read relevant and useful stuff.
The slant on positive or negative is not important.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
Tramp,,"The negativity - i love it when people share a problem they have. Sometimes they have been cute in how they have got over it and that makes me take a screenshot. Other articles of negativity i find amusing where they are doom mongers that talk the market down and then offer to buy your property. They are glorified ambulance chasers, saying they is a catastrophic accident about to happen. I just giggle at it. Enjoy the day.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
TheMaluka,,"Whilst I agree with the sentiment, I can see nothing positive for either tenants or Landlords in the RRB.",https://www.property118.com/is-it-time-to-change-the-narrative/,
